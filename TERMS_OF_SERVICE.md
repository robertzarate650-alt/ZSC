# GigSync Terms of Service

**Last Updated:** July 28, 2024

Welcome to GigSync! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the GigSync mobile application and any related services (collectively, the "Service") provided by GigSync LLC ("we," "us," or "our").

By creating an account or using our Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

### 1. The Service

GigSync is a tool designed to assist gig-economy drivers. Our Service uses AI-powered analysis to provide insights on delivery offers, optimize routes, and track performance. The Service is a co-pilot and informational tool; it does not perform deliveries, communicate with customers, or interact with delivery platform applications on your behalf.

### 2. Disclaimer of Affiliation

**GigSync is an independent service and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, sponsored by, or associated with DoorDash, Inc., Uber Technologies, Inc., Grubhub, or any of their affiliates or subsidiaries.**

The Service is designed to be used as an assistive tool for drivers who use these platforms, but it operates completely independently. All trademarks, service marks, and trade names of third-party platforms mentioned in the Service are the property of their respective owners.

### 3. User Accounts

To use most features of the Service, you must register for an account. You agree to:
- Provide accurate, current, and complete information during registration.
- Maintain the security of your password and accept all risks of unauthorized access to your account.
- Promptly notify us if you discover or suspect any security breaches related to the Service.

You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account.

### 4. Subscriptions & Payments

-   **Free Tier:** We may offer a free version of our service with limited features and usage caps.
-   **Pro Subscription:** For enhanced features, you may subscribe to our "Pro" plan. Subscription fees are billed on a recurring basis (e.g., monthly) as disclosed at the time of purchase.
-   **Billing:** By providing a payment method, you authorize us (or our third-party payment processor, like Stripe) to charge you the subscription fees automatically.
-   **Cancellation:** You may cancel your subscription at any time through the "Billing" section of the app. The cancellation will take effect at the end of the current billing period. No refunds will be provided for partial subscription periods.

### 5. Acceptable Use

You agree not to use the Service in any way that:
- Violates any applicable local, state, national, or international law.
- Infringes on the rights of others, including privacy and intellectual property rights.
- Attempts to reverse-engineer, decompile, or discover the source code of the application.
- Uses any automated system to access the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to our servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period.

### 6. Limitation of Liability

The Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. While we strive to provide accurate information and analysis, we make no warranty that the Service will be error-free or that the insights provided will guarantee increased earnings.

**To the fullest extent permitted by law, GigSync LLC shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (a) your use of the Service; (b) any unauthorized access to or use of our servers and/or any personal information stored therein.**

Your use of the insights and data provided by GigSync is at your own risk. You are solely responsible for the decisions you make regarding accepting or declining delivery offers.

### 7. Changes to Terms

We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. If we make changes, we will provide notice by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of these Terms. Your continued use of the Service after any modification constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.
