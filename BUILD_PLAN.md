### **Week 1: Core Foundation & Manual Entry**

*   **Objective:** Establish the user backbone and the primary method for data input.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   **Authentication System:** Implement user registration, login, and secure session management.
    *   **Shift Tracking:** Develop the logic to start, end, and record active driving shifts.
    *   **Manual Order Input:** Build the UI and backend logic for drivers to manually enter order details (pay, distance, restaurant).

### **Week 2: Data & Core Logic**

*   **Objective:** Implement automated data collection and the financial calculations that provide immediate value to the driver.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   **Earnings Calculations:** Develop algorithms to calculate total earnings, profit per hour, and profit per mile.
    *   **Mileage Tracking:** Integrate geolocation services to automatically track and log miles driven during an active shift.
    *   **Google Maps Integration:** Begin integrating necessary map services for distance calculation, route visualization, or traffic data.

### **Week 3: Analytics & Monetization**

*   **Objective:** Build the features that provide actionable insights and prepare the app for monetization.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   **Analytics Dashboard:** Design and build the UI to display key performance indicators (KPIs) and earnings trends.
    *   **Smart Alerts:** Implement the backend system for generating and sending notifications for high-value orders or optimal driving times.
    *   **Stripe Subscriptions:** Integrate the Stripe API to handle "Pro" tier subscriptions, payments, and cancellations.

### **Week 4: Polish, Testing & Deployment**

*   **Objective:** Refine the user experience, ensure stability, and prepare for launch.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   **UI Polish:** Conduct a full review of the user interface, improving layouts, animations, and overall aesthetics.
    *   **Beta Testing:** Onboard a select group of drivers from Redwood City to use the app in real-world conditions, gather feedback, and identify bugs.
    *   **App Store Submission:** Prepare and submit the application to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, ensuring all metadata, privacy policies, and screenshots are in order.
