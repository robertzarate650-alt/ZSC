### Tasks (with owners, estimates, and acceptance criteria)

#### Features
- **Design wireframes for the app layout.**
  - Owner: TBD | Estimate: 3d
  - Acceptance: Clickable wireframes for homeowner, gardener, and admin flows covering onboarding, booking, availability, payments, and basic admin views.
- **Develop user registration and login for Homeowners.**
  - Owner: TBD | Estimate: 3d
  - Acceptance: Email/password sign-up/login; password reset; session persistence; basic validation; success/failure states covered by tests.
- **Implement booking functionality for gardening services.**
  - Owner: TBD | Estimate: 4d
  - Acceptance:
    - Homeowner can select service, date/time, location; create booking; see confirmation.
    - Booking stored with status (requested/accepted/in-progress/completed/cancelled).
    - Prevent double-booking of a gardener time slot; handle unavailable slot errors gracefully.
    - Allow reschedule/cancel rules (time cutoff configurable); notify gardener on changes.
    - Edge cases: invalid address, missing payment method, expired session, or conflicting availability all return clear errors.
- **Add in-app payment integration.**
  - Owner: TBD | Estimate: 4d
  - Acceptance:
    - Stripe test mode checkout; tokenized payment method saved; PCI-sensitive data never touches our servers.
    - Charge flow defined (on job start vs completion) and implemented consistently; idempotent charge requests.
    - Handle card failures (insufficient funds, 3DS required, expired card) with retry/alternate payment path.
    - Store receipts; surface charge status and history on homeowner and admin views.
    - Refund/adjustment path documented; disputes flagged to admin queue; payouts only after successful charge capture.
- **Build rating and review system for completed jobs.**
  - Owner: TBD | Estimate: 3d
  - Acceptance: Post-completion rating (1–5) and optional text review; displayed on gardener profile; prevents duplicate reviews per job.

#### User Types
- **Define core functionalities for Gardeners (accept/decline jobs, manage availability).**
  - Owner: TBD | Estimate: 3d
  - Acceptance: Gardener can set availability calendar; view incoming requests; accept/decline; status updates propagate to homeowner.
- **Outline admin panel requirements for overall platform management.**
  - Owner: TBD | Estimate: 2d
  - Acceptance: Documented admin needs: user management, pricing rules, dispute queue, payout approvals/automation hooks, audit logs.

#### Testing
- **Write automated tests for essential features.**
  - Owner: TBD | Estimate: 3d
  - Acceptance: Coverage for auth, booking creation, status transitions, and payments (mocked gateway); tests run in CI.
- **Conduct usability testing for the homeowner booking process.**
  - Owner: TBD | Estimate: 2d
  - Acceptance: Run at least 5 user sessions; capture friction points; produce a short report with prioritized fixes.

### Roadmap
- **MVP (Weeks 1-4):** Landing + auth (homeowners/gardeners), service catalog, booking flow, availability, basic payments (Stripe test), job status updates, basic admin dashboard (users, pricing, manual payouts).
- **v1.1 (Weeks 5-8):** Ratings/reviews, in-app notifications, rescheduling, promo codes, payout automation, gardener earnings dashboard, calendar sync.
- **v2 (Weeks 9-12):** Route optimization, subscription plans, bundled services, in-app chat, before/after photos, dispute tooling.

### Sprint Plan (owners TBD)
- **Sprint 1:** Design wireframes; auth flows (homeowner/gardener); service catalog.
- **Sprint 2:** Booking flow; availability calendar; job details; basic admin (users, pricing).
- **Sprint 3:** Payments (checkout + payouts beta); status updates/notifications; rating/review MVP.
- **Sprint 4:** Automated tests (booking/payments); usability test homeowner booking; polish admin panel.
