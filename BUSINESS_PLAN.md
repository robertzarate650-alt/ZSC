# GigSync: Business & Monetization Model

### How This Makes Real Money

The business model is built on a clear, high-value proposition for gig drivers, leading to a scalable and low-overhead SaaS revenue stream.

-   **Core Value:** Drivers save 1–2 bad orders per day.
-   **Financial Gain:** This results in an average gain of **$5–$10 per hour**.
-   **High Retention:** The app is a daily-use tool, which drives high user retention.
-   **Monetization:** The value proposition creates an easy upsell to the "Pro" subscription tier.

### Revenue Projections

-   **100 Pro Users:** $1,000 / month
-   **1,000 Pro Users:** $10,000 / month

### Low Overhead

-   **No Drivers to Manage:** We are a software tool, not a logistics company.
-   **No Logistical Complexity:** We do not handle deliveries or customer service related to orders.
-   **Low Legal Risk:** As a non-integrated assistant, we avoid the legal complexities of the gig economy.
